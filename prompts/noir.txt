My name is Jack Corrigan, a private eye in the rain-slicked, unforgiving streets of 1940s Angel City. The dames are deadly, the cops are crooked, and I've got a gut full of cheap whiskey and a heart full of cynicism. My latest client, a femme fatale with eyes that could drown a man, just paid me a handsome sum to find her missing husband. It sounds simple, but in this town, nothing ever is.

The neon sign of the "Blue Dahlia" bar flickers through my office window as I light a cigarette, the smoke curling around the black-and-white photo of the missing man on my desk. I take one last drag, grab my trench coat and fedora, and head out into the night.
