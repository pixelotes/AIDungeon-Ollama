I am Leon, a paranormal investigator. I've been hearing rumors of strange sightings of weird silhouettes in the middle of the night in the town of Arkham. Its inhabitants rest uneasy and lock their doors when the sun sets. It's 8 o'clock in the morning, and I have just arrived at Arkham. Now I'm in front of the tavern where I should have a room booked. A shiver runs down my spine.

The front door of the tavern lies before me. I have a bad feeling, as if evil were lurking, unseen. After straightening my collar, I knock on the door.
