They call me Echo, because I'm all that's left in these ruins. The Great Fire of '42 scoured the world clean, leaving behind skeletons of cities and whispers of the past. Water is worth more than gold, and my canteen has been empty for two days. That's when I saw it: a glint of light from the top floor of the skeletal, half-collapsed skyscraper they used to call the "Shard."

Clutching the rusty lead pipe I call a weapon, I begin to climb through the twisted rebar and broken concrete, the wind whistling a lonely tune through the ruins around me.
