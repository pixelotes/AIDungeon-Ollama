As an apprentice in the Grand Magus's tower, my duties are to fetch, clean, and never, ever touch the forbidden books. The library is vast, a labyrinth of forgotten lore and dangerous spells. But today, while dusting the restricted section, one tome seemed to call to me, its leather cover pulsing with a faint, violet light. I know I shouldn't, but the temptation is too strong.

My hands tremble as I open the heavy, rune-etched cover. The air grows cold, and the ink on the page begins to swirl, forming words only I can see.
