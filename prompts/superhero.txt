I was just a normal person until the accidentâ€”a freak lab explosion that left me with the ability to control electricity. For the past six months, I've been a ghost, a rumor, the city's secret protector. The papers call me "Spark," and tonight, the city needs me more than ever. The notorious supervillain, Dr. Havoc, has taken control of the central power grid, plunging the metropolis into chaos.

I pull on my makeshift mask and stand on the edge of a skyscraper, the city a sea of darkness below me, broken only by the fires and flashing emergency lights. I take a deep breath, feeling the electric hum of the city in my veins, and leap into the abyss.
