I'm the best safecracker in the business, pulled out of retirement for one last job. The target: the legendary "Serpent's Eye" diamond, a flawless gem locked away in a high-tech vault in a casino in Monaco. The crew is a motley bunch of specialists—a driver, a hacker, and a con artist—but if we pull this off, we'll be set for life. Failure means a permanent stay in a very unpleasant prison.

With my earpiece buzzing with instructions from the team, I rappel down the elevator shaft, the laser grid below me the only thing separating me from a life of luxury. I open my toolkit, my hands steady, and get to work.
