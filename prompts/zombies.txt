It's been six months since the dead started walking. I'm a survivor, holed up in what's left of the "Galleria" shopping mall. The food is almost gone, and the constant groaning from the horde outside is a grating symphony of the apocalypse. Just when I thought all hope was lost, a voice crackled over my shortwave radio: a military broadcast, mentioning an evacuation point at the old naval base.

It's a long shot, a forty-mile trek through hell. But it's the only shot I have. I check the last magazine for my rifle, take a swig of stale water, and push open the service door to the parking garage.
