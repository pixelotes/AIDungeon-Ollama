They call me "Silas," and I'm an outlaw with a bounty on my head big enough to make a king jealous. I've spent the last three days riding through the scorching desert, with a posse of determined lawmen never far behind. My water is gone, my horse is on its last legs, and the only thing between me and the hangman's noose is the loaded six-shooter on my hip.

Just as the sun begins to set, casting long shadows across the canyons, I spot a remote, dusty cantina on the horizon. It's a risk, but it's the only one I've got. I pull my hat down low, dismount my weary horse, and push through the swinging saloon doors.
