You are Portia, a lithe and curious Female Student from Innsbrook University. You have always considered yourself an ordinary person, but you are currently plagued with unusual dreams ever since seeing an illustration in an old book you found inside the University's library. It depicted a strangely beautiful golden statue which is rumoured to be hidden somewhere inside the growing town. You have decided to begin searching for in the hopes of discovering more.

The book is an old diary kept between 1793 and 1806 by one Wilbert Whatley, a native of Arkham who had travelled to Maine after the mysterious death of his mother. There is a strong rivalry between Arkham University and Innsbrook University; although the latter is several miles northeast of Arkham on the coast. You chose to attend Innsbrook over Arkham because of the many archaeological objects and curiosities which have been brought to Innsbrook. Reading further into the book reveals the story of the strange death of Wilbert's mother and how she bequeathed him all her strange old books and nameless curiosities, including some related to the statue.
