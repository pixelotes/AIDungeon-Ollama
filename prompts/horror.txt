The car's engine died with a final, pathetic cough. I'm stranded on a desolate backroad, miles from anywhere, with no cell signal. The darkness of the surrounding woods feels absolute, a suffocating blanket of silence. The only sign of life is a single, flickering light in the window of an old, dilapidated mansion perched on the hill overlooking the road.

A storm is brewing, and staying in the car is not an option. With a deep sense of dread, I walk up the overgrown path to the imposing front door of the house and raise a hand to the heavy, iron knocker.
