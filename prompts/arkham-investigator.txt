I am Leon, a paranormal investigator. I've been hearing rumors of strange sightings of weird silhouettes in the moddle of the night, in the town of Arkham. Its inhabitants rest uneasy, and lock their doors when the sun sets. It's 8 o'clock at dawn, and I just arrived at Arkham. Now I'm in front of the tavern, where I should have a room booked. A shiver runs over from neck to legs.

The front door of the tavern lies in front of me. I have a bad feeling, as if evil were lurking unseen. After straightening my collar, I knock on the door.
