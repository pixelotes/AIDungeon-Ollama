As a child of Sparta, I was raised to be a warrior, but not even my training could prepare me for this. The gods of Olympus have chosen me for a sacred quest: to descend into the Underworld and retrieve the stolen Helm of Hades from a monstrous gorgon. The fate of the mortal realm rests on my shoulders, and the path is guarded by creatures of myth and legend.

I stand before the shadowy entrance to the Underworld, the River Styx flowing before me, the skeletal ferryman Charon extending a bony hand for payment. I place two golden coins on his palm and step onto the rickety boat, my bronze shield and spear my only companions on the journey into darkness.
